- Need to configure the python file to contain your own Chrome information.
- The script will look for all players with a Raiders image in the html and select that individual.
- Depending on the speed of your connection, you may want to alter the time.sleep() function in order to give more or less time for the page to load.
- Can alter the script to insert your teams image and vote for your team of interest.
